Embedded Motor Controller

Embedded System Design Lab:
This course provides a system design experience in electrical and computer engineering that leads to development of both technical and professional skills.  The system design projects require application of knowledge gained across the breadth of earlier courses, including the ability to design systems containing both hardware and software. In addition, there is emphasis on interpersonal skills needed for professional practice, including written and oral communication and documenting engineering work. 

The course is structured around the design of an embedded microcontroller-based speed controller for a dc motor. Various components of the system are designed and integrated over the course of the semester, with a controller designed in the final project to achieve specified behavior.

This project used the STM32L432KC microcontroller. Code was written and deployed by the Kiel uVision.
